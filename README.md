# Open Data Day Seattle 2017
A citizen powered open data visualization bonanza. In one afternoon.

## Data

It's everywhere, but today we're interested in the open stuff. Here's a few places to find some.

- [Some datasets downloaded for this event](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/77i1b9cxw6ypg8z/AADLaGZhWBzUGjIaqJuseMita?dl=0)
- [City of Seattle's Open Data Portal](https://data.seattle.gov)
- [US Government's Open Data (get it while you can!)](https://www.data.gov/)
- [World Bank Open Data](http://data.worldbank.org/)
- [Awesome Public Datasets](https://github.com/caesar0301/awesome-public-datasets)

## Visualization Tools
Some tools for vizzing that data you gone got yourself.

### No Coding

#### Tableau
Industrial strength visualization for the masses.

- [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/s/)
- [Getting Started with Tableau Videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsAPoJjARuI)

#### Excel
That's right with enough tweaking it is possible to make pretty graphs in Excel.

- [Heat Maps in Excel](http://www.excel-university.com/heat-maps-in-excel/)

### Some Coding

The language R comes with an array of brilliant visualization and plotting libraries. All of this can be done through the self-contained RStudio environment.

### A Bit More Coding

#### Python

Python is the other language of choice for data analysis. If you've coded in Python before then making visualizations will be easy.

This easiest way to play around with data and visualizations is with a [Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org/). Today you can just jump straight into playing with Python in a notebook in your browser at:

Loading your data with pandas is as easy as:

```python
import pandas as pd # load pandas
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv') # read csv file into a DataFrame
df.head() # show headers and first rows of dataframe
```

#### Code it From Scratch
Sometimes out-of-the-box packages just wont cut it. D3 is a powerful web visualization package based on JavaScript. It can do [just about anything you want](https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki/Gallery).
